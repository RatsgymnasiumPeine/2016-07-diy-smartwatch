## Step 1 - Printing the 3D Parts ##

The first step ist to build the enclosure of the smartwatch. You can either build one yourself out of wood, metal or some other stuff with a technique of your choice or you 3d print the files provided in the repository.
We printed our cases with the side of the watches on the printbed, 0.3mm layer height, 40% infill and about 50mm/s speed. Of course you can fine tune these settings.
