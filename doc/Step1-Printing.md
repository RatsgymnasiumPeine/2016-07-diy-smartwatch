## Step 1 - Printing the 3D Parts ##

The first step ist to build the enclosure of the smartwatch. You can either build one yourself out of wood, metal or some other stuff with a technique of your choice or you 3d print the files provided in the repository. Alternativly you can get one enclosure printed on [3dhubs.com](https://www.3dhubs.com/).
We printed our cases with the side of the watches on the printbed, 0.3mm layer height, 40% infill and about 50mm/s speed. Of course you can fine tune these settings.

- [Bottom](https://github.com/laubed/diy-smartwatch/raw/master/case/Bottom.stl)

Print these two with the settings of your choice, remove them from the printbed, remove the burr and clean them up. Espacially the top part needs some cleanup because of the support structure where the display goes.
You can now continue with step 2.
